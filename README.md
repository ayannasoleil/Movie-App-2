# MOVIE FINDER APP 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview:

This is a React single page application with components, props, client-side routing, data from the TMDb API and the use of state management.

## Description:

* This single page application was built to display the working knowledge of React/JSX. The Movie Finder app includes an external API from TMDb as well. 

* Upon entering the app, the user is met with an About, Favorites, Home and Search page. The user can begin by searching for a movie of their choice. 

* Once that movie generates, the user can then add the movie to their favorites list. The movie can be removed as desired as well.

## Features: 

* Single Page Application
* 5 components (minimum)
* 3 client-side routes (minimum)
* External API

## How To Use: 



## Requirements:

* You must make a single page application (only one index.html file) using create-react-app

* Your app should use at least 5 components in a way that keeps your code well organized

* There should be at least 3 client-side routes using react-router

* Use a json-server to create a RESTful API for your backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server. Additionally, you may choose to incorporate data from an external API but it is not required.
